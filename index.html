<p  style="color:powderblue; font-size:27px;"> The oceans covers more than 70% of Earth's surface and holds about 97% of all water found on earth.It is divided into 5 major basins the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Arctic, and Southern. We have only discovered <10% of it. Within it there is a estimated 700,000 to 1 million species that inhabit it. We have only discovered 226,000 ocean species. The average depth of the entire ocean is 12,200 feet. Dispite light being unable to 3,300 feet lifeforms are still found that deep. However due to gobal warming heating up the ocean's temperature many species are at risk of population deline and extinction.</p>
